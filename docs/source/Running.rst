Running
=======

From the tools available above the list, under maven projects, select Toggle 'Skip Tests' Mode which cancels out the test option under all the dropdowns in the Librehealth toolkit. This option is selected mainly to aid the user by not running some optional verification tests each time the module is built. Clicking on install under the lifecycle builds the lifecycle module as shown in the images below.
