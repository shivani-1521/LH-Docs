The lh-toolkit is a software API and interface which forms the basis to create health record systems. This forms the basis of LibreHealth where the users can create a customized medical records system with minimal or no programming knowledge. Since this has to be accessible to users from different departments  like researchers, clinicians, planners, epidemiologists and patients, the lh-toolkit can be considered as the core part of this project.

The lh-toolkit is one of the projects under the librehealth gruop in GitLab. It contains some of the most important software and interface required to co-ordinate with the other projects of LibreHealth  like librehealth-radiology, open-decision-framework and run efficiently. The table below can be refrred to understand the repositories present in lh-toolkit.
